## Demo

Check out our [live demo](https://your-demo-link.com) to experience the app in action!

## How It Works

1. **Input Prompt**: Provide descriptive and imaginative prompts to the AI, such as "a cat made of clouds" or "a surreal landscape with floating houses."
2. **AI Processing**: The app sends the prompt to the OpenAI DALL-E model, which generates a visual representation of the given text.
3. **View Generated Images**: Users can view, save, and share the AI-generated images created based on the prompts.
